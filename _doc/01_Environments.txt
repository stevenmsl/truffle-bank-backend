- Prerequisites
  - Ganache is installed locally and is up and running

- npm scripts
  - posinstall and compile
    - these two scripts are the same
    - posinstall will be executed automatically after you ran "npm install"
    - you should run compile every time you modify any contracts
      - this will make sure the content of the "types" folder is up to date   
  - prettier     
    - format your solidity code
  - deploy-dev
    - deploy to the local Ganache
  - deploy-dev-clean
    - remove all contracts before deploy them
    - this to work, it requires the network_id to set 
      to * in the truffle-config.js  
        development: {
        host: "127.0.0.1",
        port: 7545,
        network_id: "*",
      }, 

- run tests
  - make sure Ganache is up and running locally
  - command: npm run test
  - command: npm run test-redeploy
    - this will re-deploy all contracts before
      running the tests
