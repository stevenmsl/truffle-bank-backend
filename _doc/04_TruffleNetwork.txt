- command: truffle networks
  - this show you what contracts have been deployed to
    what networks

- command: truffle networks --clean
  - this will only remove all network artifacts 
    that aren't associated with a named network.

  - so in your truffle-config.js, if you specify
    a partiuclar network id, artifacts won't be
    remove from that network as it's named:
     development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 7545,
      network_id: "5777",
    },

  - since I can't find any command to remove 
    artifacts from a named network, just keep
    the network_id: "*" if you want to remove 
    all the contracts you deployed not just
    replace them.

  - this command will also clean up the networks
    property in the contract JSON files located in the
    truffle_abis folder: 
    "networks": {},  

- deploying contracts
  - command: npm run deploy-dev
  - the networks property in the JSON file of the deployed
    contracts will be modified accordingly:
    "networks": {
        "5777": {
        "events": {},
        "links": {},
        "address": "0xF147F34dB34258A832cE380b4490e9208357570e",
        "transactionHash": "0x323759f5503582b0a8cfd7e38d77d7c8646d31b989f55b04ca8a602daf33fa90"
        }
    }
  - from this point onward if you don't remove the artifacts you are
    just replacing the contracts that has new address every time 
    you run "npm run deploy-dev"
